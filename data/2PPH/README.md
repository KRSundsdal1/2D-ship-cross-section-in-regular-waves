# 2PPH - Scenario A: Fixed model

These files are the unfiltered measurements from the fixed model tests, containig time series from the following sensors

We have the data from 7 sensors in these tests
- `WM_Position [m]`: he horizontal stroke of the wave maker measured 1.5 m above the hinge.
- `WP_* [m]`: The surface elevation measured at wave probes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, described in the [experimental setup](../../docs/experimental_setup.md).
- `F* [N]`: The forces in x, y, and z axis as measured by the 6DOF force transducer described in the [experimental setup](../../docs/experimental_setup.md).
- `M* [Nm]`: The moments about the x, y, and z axis as measured by the 6DOF force transducer described in the [experimental setup](../../docs/experimental_setup.md).
