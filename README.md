# 2D-ship-cross-section-in-regular-waves
D experiments on a ship-shaped section in regular beam-sea waves, testing fixed, 3-DOF, and 2-DOF setups. The study replicates and extends Nojiri &amp; Murayama (1975) using a Froude-scaled model in a wave flume to investigate hydrodynamic forces and motions.
